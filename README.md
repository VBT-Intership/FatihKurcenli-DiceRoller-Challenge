# Fatih Kur√ßenli - Anatomy Of Basic Android Project

## Dice Roller

Solution code for the challenge app in Android Kotlin Fundamentals Codelab 1.2: Get Started

# How To Works

DiceRoller-challenge adds onto DiceRoller with a Count Up button that does the following:

- If the result TextView is the default "Hello World!" it sets that text to 1.
- If the result TextView has a number other than 6, it increments that number.
- If the result TextView is already 6, it does nothing.
